Description
"Some bees convinced me to invest in their new cryptosystem. They said their new XOR keystream would revolutionize the crypto market. However, they quickly buzzed away so all I have is this weird flyer they dropped. Luckily it has some source code on the back."
"Have I just really been scammed by some bees??"

Note: The flyer is not needed to solve the challenge, it's just for fun.
